This simple Android project shows how to create custom Gradle tasks and how to automate your building process. In our case, simple task is created that automatically copies the debug apk file to desired place as well as renaming it after build. It also creates a file with checksum of the apk. It also runs your all unit tests and if one of your unit tests fail, whole process for building project fails.
